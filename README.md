# Task Manager (Python + PostgreSQL)

This is a simple task manager CLI app written in Python using PostgreSQL as the database.

The goal was to build a working login and task management system from scratch, practice writing clean code, 
and prep the project for future improvements like testing, APIs, and possibly a web version.
